            <p>
              The Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium Model describes a hypothetical
              world where allele frequencies remain constant over time, i.e. one
              where evolution does not take place. If random events are
              introduced, they will affect allele frequencies. Therefore
              evolution will be taking place and the Hardy-Weinberg model will
              no longer apply.

            <h2>Evolution</h2>
            <p>
              Evolution can be defined as the change in allele frequencies in a
              population over generations. Both natural selection and genetic
              drift are mechanisms of evolution.
            </p>

            <dl>
              <dt>Natural Selection</dt>
              <dd>
                Changes in allele frequencies in a population over generations
                as a result of their fitness for reproduction. The effects of
                natural selection become apparent only in large populations over
                long time periods.
              </dd>
              <dt>Genetic Drift</dt>
              <dd>
                Changes in allele frequencies in a population over generations
                due to random events. The effects of genetic drift appear mainly
                in small populations over short time periods and result in
                reduction of genetic variation.

          <!-- GENETIC DRIFT -->
          <section>
            <h2>Genetic Drift</h2>
            <p>
              Genetic drift, while not being as important as natural selection
              as a driver in evolution, nevertheless affects allele frequencies.
              An event (such as an earthquake) might kill a large percentage of
              a population. Before the event the frequencies for the alleles of
              particular gene might have been 50/50. After, entirely dependent
              on chance, they could be 25/75 or 80/20, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              Genetic drift is particularly evident in smaller populations. This
              reflects the law of large numbers.
            </p>
            <h3>The law of large numbers</h3>
            <p>
              The law of large numbers states that in the long run random events
              tend to average out at the expected value.
            </p>

            <h4>Example: tossing a coin</h4>
            <p>
              There are two sides to a coin so the probability of heads landing
              is 50&percnt; and the probability of tails landing is also
              50&percnt;. The expected value is therefore 0.5.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, if we tossed the coin only ten times, we wouldn't be
              surprised if heads landed 70&percnt; of the time and tails
              30&percnt; of the time, or even 100&percnt; and 0&percnt; of the
              time.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, if we tossed the coin a million times, we would
              be very surprised if we obtained these ranges of values. It is
              much more likely that the result would be very close to 50&percnt;
              for either side, i.e. close to the expected value of 0.5. (As up
              to ten simulations can be run at the same time, drifting to both
              fixation and loss may be seen as possible outcomes in the same
              chart.)

            <h2>Causes of Genetic Drift</h2>
            <p>
              As we have seen, a small population can rapidly drift towards
              fixation or loss of alleles, resulting in loss of genetic
              variation. Random events can cause a large population to become a
              smaller one in a relatively short period of time.
            </p>
            <p>
              The two main categories of random event which can drastically
              reduce population size are:
            </p>
            <dl>
              <dt>1) The bottleneck effect</dt>
              <dd>
                A disease spreads through a large rabbit colony, eventually
                killing over 90&percnt; of the population. By chance, the small
                group of survivors only carry the homozygous recessive genotype
                for white fur. Result: all future generations will have white
                fur. The allele for white fur will have drifted to fixation, for
                brown fur to loss.
              </dd>
              <dt>2) The founder effect</dt>
              <dd>
                A landslide separates a small group of rabbits from the main
                colony. By chance, this group only carries the heterozygous
                dominant genotype for brown fur. Result: the entire next
                generation of the newly-founded colony will have brown fur. The
                allele for brown fur will have drifted to fixation, for white
                fur to loss.
              </dd>
            </dl>

            <p>
              A more detailed examination of the bottleneck and founder effects
              will be discussed in a later article.
